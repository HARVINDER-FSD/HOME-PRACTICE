    <p>We call it the solar system because it is made up of our star, the Sun, and everything bound to it by gravity – the planets Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune; dwarf planets Pluto, Ceres, Makemake, Haumea, and Eris – along with hundreds of moons; 
        and millions of asteroids, comets, and meteoroids.</p>
    <h1>Solar System Overview</h1>
    <p>The solar system has one star, eight planets, five dwarf planets, at least 290 moons, more than 1.3 million asteroids, and
    <BR> about 3,900 comets.It is located in an outer spiral arm of the Milky Way galaxy called the Orion Arm, or Orion Spur. Our solar<br> system orbits the center of the galaxy at about 515,000 mph (828,000 kph).It takes about 230 million years to complete one <br>orbit around the galactic center.</p>
